Gaphor in a Container

Instead of setting up a development environment locally, the easiest way to contribute to the project is using GitHub Codespaces.
GitHub Codespaces

Follow these steps to open Gaphor in a Codespace:

    Navigate to https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor

    Click the Code drop-down menu and select the Open with Codespaces option.

    Select + New codespace at the bottom on the pane.

For more info, check out the GitHub documentation.
Remote access to Gaphor graphic window with Codespaces

When using Codespaces, chances are that you also want to interact with the graphical window of Gaphor.

This is facilitated in Gaphor by use of container feature called desktop-lite. This feature is activated by default in the Gaphor’s devcontainer.json file.

Notice the webPort/vncPort and password values. These are used in subsequent steps.

    		"desktop-lite": {
			"password": "vscode",
			"webPort": "6080",
			"vncPort": "5901"
		},

There are two options:
Using a local VNC viewer

    Download and install VNC viewer of your choice (e.g. realvnc)

    Specify remote hostname as localhost and port as 5901 and connect VNC. The port number should be same as specified in attribute vncPort

    Upon debugging/running Gaphor the familiar Graphic window should be displayed in VNC view

Using noVNC viewer on the Browser

    This is based on noVNC application

    Open the browser on your local machine and give address as http://127.0.0.1:6080/. The port number should be same as specified in attribute webPort

    A noVNC window will open, click on Connect and provide password as vscode. The password should be same as specified in attribute password

    Upon debugging/running Gaphor the familiar Graphic window should be displayed in noVNC view on Browser
