Act as a senior MBSE architect specialized in Capella (Arcadia methodology).

Create a complete MBSE project structure to be used in Capella for an
infrastructure automation platform based on:
- VMware Aria Automation
- vRealize Orchestrator (workflows and actions)
- Service Broker (catalogs and UI forms)

The system must integrate with:
- vCenter
- IPAM
- Network services
- F5 load balancers
- Two datacenters (Datacenter A and Datacenter B)

Apply and clearly align with the following standards and methodologies:
- ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 (architecture description, stakeholders, concerns, viewpoints)
- ISO/IEC 15288 (system lifecycle processes)
- Arcadia methodology (Operational Analysis, System Analysis, Logical Architecture, Physical Architecture)

Deliverables required:
1. A folder structure ready to be used as a Capella MBSE project
2. Clear explanations of each Arcadia phase (OA, SA, LA, PA)
3. Examples specific to VMware automation for each phase
4. Traceability guidance from operational needs to physical implementation
5. Reusable templates and procedures so the structure can be applied to other projects
6. A README explaining how to use the project as an MBSE template
7. Output packaged as a ZIP file

The result must be:
- Tool-agnostic at OA and SA levels
- Logically structured at LA level
- Fully mapped to real components at PA level
- Suitable for enterprise-scale reuse and audits

Use professional MBSE language, but keep explanations practical and implementation-oriented.
